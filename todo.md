# To Do:
### better color picker
#### the current color picker sucks and is different accross devices
### fix undo
#### the current undo hotkey causes the brush size to be reset in chrome
### implement more tools
#### ideally bucket, box, and line tools should be implemented
### opacity
#### opacity should be implemented in a simple way that works accross tools
### implement redo
#### self explanatory, not sure what way would be best though. need to think about data structure.
### organize files
#### the script file has grown too large, it needs to be split into many files. This will be really difficult due to the way I implemented variable scopes.
### better algorithms
#### while it was fun to code algorithms on my own, they are also slow. Either add library/API or write better code.
### reorganize painting panel
#### I am not really satisfied with the current layout
